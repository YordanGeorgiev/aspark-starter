## 1. WAY OF WORKING


     

### 1.1. Issues handling
Each proper time spent on time saves 10 times more in execution, thus the tasks and aktivities related to this tool are tracked via the issue-tracker tool:
https://github.com/YordanGeorgiev/issue-tracker
and could be found @:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-oYPtBM8PG_FUogk40RDmcM_Xzq91Tb81Zlyi0cMwYQ/edit#gid=135774576

    

### 1.2. Documentation
The purpose of the tool is to "grasp the concept of apache spark", thus a proper documentation set is created as well.

    

## 2. NAMING CONVENTIONS


     

### 2.1. Dirs naming conventions
The dir structure should be logical and a person navigating to a dir should almost understand what is to be find in thre by its name .. 

    

### 2.2. Root Dirs naming conventions
The root dirs and named as follows:
bin - contains the produced binaries for th project
cnf - for the configuration
dat - for the data of the app
lib - for any external libraries used
src - for the source code of the actual projects and subprojects

    

### 2.3. Bash scripts naming conventions
Do not use capital letters - they are too noisy.

    

### 2.4. Scala code naming conventions


    

## 3. INSTALLATIONS AND CONFIGURATIONS


     

### 3.1. Install Scala


    

#### 3.1.1. Install sbt


    

### 3.2. Install apache spark
